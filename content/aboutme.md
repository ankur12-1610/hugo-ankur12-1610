Namaste. I'm Ankur Patil, your friendly neighborhood developer with a passion for creating things. 

<img src="/profileImg.jpg" alt="Profile Pic" height="400"/>

My recent achievement includes winning at the Aptos Labs Blockchain Hackathon during InterIIT Tech Meet 12.0 with my creation of a Decentralized Trading Platform on the Aptos blockchain.

Currently, I am freelancing at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) as a problem-setter (mostly python based). I have also interned with companies like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Element](https://element.io)/[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org), [Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com) and [Silence Laboratories](https://www.silencelaboratories.com).

I have been open sourcing from past few years, I have cracked prestigious open source fellowships and internships: 
- [Linux Foundation Mentroship (LFX)](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) 2023: Worked with Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes
- [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org) 2022: Worked with Specter Solutions (now acquired by Swan Bitcoin)
- **Element/Matrix.org**: My significant contributions during the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2022 led to an internship offer from Element/Matrix.org.


If you're curious about my journey, feel free to explore [My Journey]("/myjourney"). I thrive on continuous learning and look forward to new challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Apart from tech, I really love football (Fun Fact: I'm a proud member of my college football team) and currently find joy in playing gully cricket. xD
